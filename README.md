# Elgato Key Light turn on/off with webcam

Detects camera on/off events and enables/disables Elgato Key Lights on MacOS. May work with other light variants (e.g. Air) but not tested as I don't have any.

Needs to be started with administrator privileges to hook into `log stream`, but runs in the background without.

You can find the IP address of your lights in the Control Center settings for each.
